## Download

Download the project on github.com/Mozartted/InquisteeSocial or clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mozartted/InquisteeSocial.git InquisteeSocial
```
this would create a folder InquisteeSocial and clone the project into the folder


## Installation

[PHP](https://php.net) 5.6+ or [HHVM](http://hhvm.com) 3.3+, and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) are required.

First, pull in the packages through Composer.

``` bash
$ composer update
```
In the storage directory create an sqlite file called inquistee.sqlite and the run the following command in console

```php
    $ php artisan migrate --path database/migrations/migration_main_set
		$ php artisan migrate --path database/migrations/migration_likes
		$ php artisan migrate --path database/migrations/migrations_pivot_tables
```
There are 4 sets of migrations namely
* migration_profile_set - this creates the main tables of the application
* migration_like - this creates the ables associated with like features
* migrations_pivot_tables - the pivot tables go here.

After these simply serve via artisan and you are good to go :smile:
```php
$	php artisan serve
```
